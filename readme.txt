This project was done by two people as seen in the website

This website allows users to create an account, browse an online catalog of 
items, add the items to a shopping cart and checkout the items. If the user 
logs out with items in their shopping cart, those items will still be in 
their shopping cart when they log back in.
It also sends email to the user when they create a shopping cart
In simple words it is a shopping site made up of HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT AND PHP
